# Contributing to Eclipse sensiNact

Eclipse sensiNact is an open source project hosted by the Eclipse Foundation. Contributions are accepted from across the community.

## Issues

If you're having a problem with Eclipse Fennec then our first recommendation would be to look at [the README](https://github.com/eclipse-fennec/!#project-symbolic-name#!).

If you're still having problems then search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/eclipse-fennec/!#project-symbolic-name#!/issues) for a relevant issue or create a new one.

## Contributing code

We are always happy to welcome new contributors ‚ù§Ô∏è. If you want to contribute fixes or enhancements to Eclipse Fennec then you can do so using a *triangular workflow*.

* To make things easier for everyone, please start by checking if you have already signed the [ECA](#contributor-license)
* Fork the repository in GitHub and make changes in your fork.
  - Make sure that your changes are small and easy to understand. Separate changes into multiple commits where that makes sense
  - Commit messages should be detailed and descriptive
  - Include automated tests for any bug fixes and new code. Contributions submitted without tests may not be accepted.
  - Each commit should try to do one thing, and the code should build cleanly with each commit
* Submit a pull request to the Eclipse Fennec repository
  - Relate the pull request to an existing issue or discussion. This will give reviewers context for your changes and make the review process faster üöÄ.
  - Make sure that the pull request passes all of the CI checks

## Build

The Eclipse Fennec build requires below as dependencies.

- Java 11+
- [Bndtools](https://bnd.bndtools.org/)
- Gradle - we use the Gradle-Wrapper, so there is no need to install gradle

The Eclipse Fennec build uses code generation in some components. Please Run the full build once before attempting to load the code into your IDE.

```bash
./gradlew clean build -x test -x testOSGi
```

Now you can open the project in your IDE and it won't complain about missing files. You'll be able to use the IDE to perform incremental builds and run tests. You should rarely need to run the maven build, except when:

- you want to force a clean build
- your changes affect code generation
- you want to see if your changes will pass [the same builds that GitHub Actions runs](https://github.com/eclipse-fennec/!#project-symbolic-name#!/actions)

## Semantic Versioning

Eclipse Fennec version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). This means we increment the major version when we make incompatible API changes. This includes any changes which

- break binary compatibility
- break source compatibility

We will also activate API - baselining to help developers on that.
